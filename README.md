// This text will help you navigate and understand the macro for LFA analysis.

The macro performs the following steps:

* Splits the image into color channels.
* Lets you choose the channel to analyze.
* Straightens the user-defined line, creating a straight representation of the curved profile.
* Sets the desired line width, which determines the thickness of the analyzed area.
* Extracts the intensity data using "Image to Results," which creates a table of x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and intensity values.
* Saves the results to a CSV file.
* Optionally closes the other color channels.

Troubleshooting:

* "Selection Required" Error:  If you encounter this error, make sure you have selected three points on the image using the segmented line tool before running the macro. First two points are made via left click, third click indicates the end of the line.
* Other Errors: If you encounter other errors, double-check that your image is properly calibrated and that you have copied the macro code correctly.
* Known issue: Sometimes due to ImageJ limitations, the channel selector prompt won't put the desired channel at the front to begin making the lines. Always double check this step and manually select the channel If needed.
